Run file size checks and fix oversized files using sub-agents.

**Usage:**
- `/check-filesize` - Run make check-filesize and fix oversized files

**Action:** Executes the harness script which runs `make check-filesize`, parses failures, and spawns sub-agents to split oversized files. Uses escalation ladder (sonnet:think → opus:think → opus:ultrathink) and commits on success.
