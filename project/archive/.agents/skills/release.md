## Release Workflow

git reset --soft <previous-release-commit>

# Create release commit with full changelog
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
rel-##: Description

<changelog body>
EOF
)"
```

### 3. Tag the Release

```bash
git tag rel-##
```

### 4. Push

git push --force origin main
git push origin rel-##
```

2. `make check` - All tests pass
3. `make lint` - Complexity/size checks pass
4. `make coverage` - 100% coverage maintained
5. `make check-dynamic` - Sanitizers pass
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes

git push --force origin main
```

## Rewriting History
