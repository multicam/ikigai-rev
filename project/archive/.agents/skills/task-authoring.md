# Task Authoring

Guidance for creating task files from requirements (user stories, bugs, gaps).

## Process

1. **Review source material** - Read and understand the requirements thoroughly
2. **Think deeply** - Consider edge cases, dependencies, and implementation approaches
3. **Break down** - Split into smallest achievable, testable units

## Task File Requirements

### Model/Thinking Selection

Choose minimum capability needed for each task:

| Complexity | Model | Thinking |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Straightforward | sonnet | none |
| Moderate | sonnet | thinking |
| Complex | sonnet | extended |
| Very complex | opus | extended |

Default to `sonnet/none` and escalate only when complexity demands it.

### Skill Loading

- Load all skills the sub-agent will need (err on the side of more)
- Include relevant developer skills for implementation tasks
- **Never load `align`** - sub-agents execute, they don't negotiate

### Source Code Links

- Provide specific file paths the agent will need
- Include both implementation files and test patterns
- Link to related existing code as examples

### Pre/Post Conditions

- Pre-conditions must be verifiable before starting
- Post-conditions must be testable after completion
- Chain logically: post(N) = pre(N+1)

### Context (What/How/Why)

Every task must provide:

- **What** - The specific goal
- **How** - Approach and patterns to follow
- **Why** - Business/technical rationale

This context enables agents to handle unforeseen issues intelligently.

### Sub-agent Guidance

Include in task instructions:

- Suggest sub-agent use where appropriate (research, parallel work)
- Encourage persistence - overcome obstacles to complete the goal
- Task success is the measure, not partial progress
