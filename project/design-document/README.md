# Ikigai Design Document

## A Developer Platform for Autonomous Agents

---

## Summary

Ikigai is a platform for building, deploying, and operating autonomous AI agents on Linux. A small team with well-orchestrated agents can have the awareness and reach of a much larger organization, watching for things that matter, synthesizing information, and acting when conditions are right.

The platform handles the infrastructure (queues, messaging, telemetry, deployment, identity) so you can focus on what your agents should do, what patterns matter, and how they coordinate. Direct access to the models you choose: your API keys, your usage, your costs. No middleman between you and the LLM.

The platform philosophy: **use Linux, don't abstract it.** Identity is Linux users via PAM. Secrets are files with permissions. Agents run as systemd services. Start with one server. Most people never need more.

## Core Principles

1. **Use Linux, don't abstract it**: Identity is PAM, secrets are files, processes are systemd services. Linux solved these problems decades ago; Ikigai leverages that work rather than reinventing it.

2. **Opinionated defaults, escape hatches when needed**: PostgreSQL handles queues, messaging, storage, caching, and telemetry out of the box. One dependency, zero configuration. When specific needs arise, swap individual services to specialized backends without changing agent code.

3. **Developer experience through conversation**: Ikigai Terminal understands the entire platform, how to write agents, deploy them, and operate them. Describe what you want; the complexity is handled automatically.

4. **Direct model access**: Your API keys, your chosen providers, your costs. No platform sitting between you and the LLMs your agents use.
