# ikigai

Ikigai is a terminal-based coding agent written in C for Linux, similar in purpose to Claude Code but designed as a modular, experimental platform. It supports multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) and records all user and LLM messages as events in PostgreSQL, creating a permanent conversation history that outlives any single context window. Agents are organized in an unbounded process tree — users create long-lived agents with custom system prompts built from stacked pinned documents, and those agents can spawn temporary child agents as needed. The flagship feature, currently in development, is a sliding context window: you set a token budget, old messages fall off the back, and a reserved portion is filled with automatically generated summaries drawn from the complete database history. The codebase is built to production standards but structured for experimentation — modular and plug-and-play so new ideas can be tested without destabilizing what works.

> **This file is an index, not an encyclopedia.** It tells you where to find information, not the information itself. Each skill listed below is a self-contained document you load on demand with `/load <name>`. If you need to understand the database schema, load `database`. If you need error handling patterns, load `errors`. Don't assume information is missing just because it isn't inlined here — check the skill table first, then load what you need. Resist the urge to front-load everything; load skills relevant to your current task and trust that the detail is there when you follow the pointer.

### Skillsets

Use `/skillset <name>` to load a skillset.

| Skillset | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `developer` | Writing new code (TDD, style, quality, coverage, jj) |
| `architect` | Architectural decisions (DDD, DI, patterns, naming) |
| `security` | Discovering security flaws |
| `meta` | Improving the .claude/ system |

## Quality Harnesses

Run `/load harness` before using any harness scripts. Never run `make` targets directly — the check scripts are the only interface. All check scripts accept `--file=PATH` to check a single file. All scripts are on PATH via `.claude/scripts/`.

### Development Inner Loop (while coding)

After changing a file, run the relevant check with `--file=PATH` on that file:

- `check-compile --file=PATH` after every edit
- `check-unit --file=PATH` when a test file exists
- Other checks as relevant to the change

Stay in this single-file loop. It takes seconds. Do not run project-wide checks during active development.

### Standard Checks (exit gate — run once when work is complete)

Six checks run project-wide in order, once, when all changes are done:

| Check | What it verifies |
|-------|------------------|
| `check-compile` | Code compiles cleanly |
| `check-link` | Linker succeeds |
| `check-filesize` | File size under 16KB |
| `check-unit` | Unit tests pass |
| `check-integration` | Integration tests pass |
| `check-complexity` | Function complexity limits |

This is the default meaning of "all checks pass" in any goal. If any fail, fix and re-run only the failing check, not all six.

### Deep Checks (only when explicitly requested)

Five additional checks run only when the goal or user explicitly asks for them:

| Check | What it verifies |
|-------|------------------|
| `check-sanitize` | Address/UB sanitizer clean |
| `check-tsan` | ThreadSanitizer clean |
| `check-valgrind` | Valgrind memcheck clean |
| `check-helgrind` | Valgrind helgrind clean |
| `check-coverage` | 90% line coverage met |


## Running the Application

**You must use `--headless` mode.** Without it, ikigai renders to the alternate terminal buffer — no visible output, no way to interact from an agent session.

```bash
bin/ikigai --headless &          # Start in background (no TTY required)
ikigai-ctl read_framebuffer      # Read screen contents
ikigai-ctl send_keys "hello\r"   # Send keystrokes (\r = Enter)
```

See `/load ikigai-ctl` for full protocol. Socket auto-discovered from `run/`. Kill the process when done.

## Development

Before modifying any `.c` or `.h` files, run `/load memory errors style naming ctags`.

### Testing Workflow

**While coding** — use single-file checks with `--file=PATH`:

```sh
check-compile --file=apps/ikigai/parser.c    # After every edit
check-unit --file=tests/unit/parser_test.c   # When test file exists
```

This is your inner loop. Stay here. Do not run project-wide checks during active development.

**When work is complete** — run the six standard checks project-wide, in order:

```sh
check-compile
check-link
check-filesize
check-unit
check-integration
check-complexity
```

If any fail, fix and re-run only the failing check. These six checks are the default exit gate for all work.

**Deep checks** — run only when explicitly requested:

```sh
check-sanitize      # Only when goal asks for sanitizer checks
check-tsan          # Only when goal asks for thread safety verification
check-valgrind      # Only when goal asks for memory analysis
check-helgrind      # Only when goal asks for thread error detection
check-coverage      # Only when goal asks for coverage verification
```

### Tech Stack

- **C** (C11) with headers co-located alongside source
- **PostgreSQL** for persistence
- **talloc** for hierarchical memory management
- **jj** (Jujutsu) for version control

### Version Control

**"All files" means ALL files.** When the user says to commit, push, restore, or rebase "all files", that means every modified file in the working copy — no exceptions. Never selectively exclude files based on your own judgment about which changes are "relevant" or "from this session." The working copy is the source of truth.

This project uses **jj** (Jujutsu), a git-compatible VCS. Never use git commands directly.

```sh
jj git fetch              # Fetch remote
jj new main@origin        # Start fresh on main
jj status                 # Check status
jj diff                   # View changes
jj log                    # View log
jj commit -m "msg"        # Commit
```

Full jj workflow: `/load jj`

### Code Style

- C11, no compiler extensions
- Headers co-located with .c files
- `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Typed errors via Result pattern: `OK()` / `ERR()`
- talloc for all heap allocation (hierarchical ownership)
- 16KB max file size — split before it hurts

Full style guide: `/load style`

### Environment

Configured via `.envrc` (direnv). PATH includes `scripts/bin/` for goal scripts and `.claude/scripts/` for harness scripts. Services communicate via `RALPH_*` env vars.
